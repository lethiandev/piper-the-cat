Did you ever wonder what would it be like to be a cat? No wonder no more! In this game you're Piper the CAT! Try to rearrange items found in the household, touch 'em, smash 'em, just introduce your chaos!

This game is still unfinished and buggy, if you experience performance loss on the web platform, try to download the executable, it should work way better.
